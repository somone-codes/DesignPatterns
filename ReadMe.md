**Design Patterns in Java**

`This repo consits of implementations of design patterns based on the knowledge
obtained from the book - Head First Design Patterns`

1. **Pattern 1 - Strategy Pattern**
    > _Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate
      them from what stays the same_  
      _Program to an interface, not an implementation._  
      _Favor composition over inheritance_  

2. **Pattern 2 - Observer Patten**
    > _The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many
       dependency between objects so that when one
       object changes state, all of its dependents are 
       notified and updated automatically_  
      _Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact_
